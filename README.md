Me and a friend (Aviv Adar) wrote this site as part of a project in Network course.
We wrote this site in c# and we used sql-sever 2012 in order to store all of the site data.
In order to save the data we used Microsoft Framework Entity Code First.
We used jQuery in order to do some asynchronous actions.
In order to make the site eye freindly we used bootstrap 4.
